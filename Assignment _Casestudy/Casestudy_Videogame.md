*To answer the above question, use the following SQL queries to explore the dataset and address the following questions:*

Which genres contribute the most to global sales?

SQL:
```sql
SELECT
   Genre,
SUM(Global_Sales) AS Total_Global_Sales
FROM VGSALES
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY Total_Global_Sales DESC;
```
| #   | Genre          | Total_Global_Sales |

Action has been the dominant genre for over a decade, peaking in 2009 with 139.36M global sales, while Sports and Role-Playing had strong peaks in 2006 and 1999, respectively. Earlier genres like Puzzle and Platform were more popular in the 1980s and 1990s, but gradually declined over time.

For platform:

The PlayStation platform dominated multiple generations, with PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 consistently ranking among the highest-selling consoles, while the Wii saw a massive peak in 2009, nearly matching PS2‚Äôs best year. Early gaming was led by Atari 2600 and NES, but as the industry evolved, newer consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4 took over the market, maintaining high global sales into the 2010s.
